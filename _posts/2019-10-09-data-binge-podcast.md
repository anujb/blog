Had the pleasure of a delightful and engaging conversation with Derek Russell on the Data Binge Podcast.

Topics: 
- Software and leveraged activities
- Culture and places
- AI and Mixed Reality
- Thoughtfulness in human connection

This inspired me to consider starting my own short form podcast, meaning roughly ~10min. Would love to hear from you on topics that you might find interesting.
